# Product Description Complex Query

This Python script, named `product-description-complex-query.py`, is designed to compile product descriptions that are scattered across multiple tables in a database into a single comprehensive output. The output data includes product codes, quantities, unit types, pricing information, and more.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.7+
-   Libraries: pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy
-   Access to a database compatible with SQLAlchemy (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)

## Usage

1.  Modify the `DATABASE_URI` in the script to match your database's URI.
    
2.  Replace `'table1'`, `'table2'`, and `'table3'` with the actual table names in your database.
    
3.  Run the script with Python:
    

bashCopy code

`python product-description-complex-query.py` 

The script will print the resulting DataFrame, which contains the combined product description and associated data.

## Warning

This script should be used as a reference and requires modifications based on your specific database schema and needs.
